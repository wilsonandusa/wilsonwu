//A binary tree is a tree in which each node has up to two children. Not all trees are binary trees. 
//A binary search tree is a binary tree in which every node fits a specific ordering property:
//all left descendents <= n < all right descendents.

//Complete Binary Trees: a complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level of the tree is fully filled, except perhaps for the last
// last level. To the extent that the last level is filled, it is filled left to right.

//Full binary Tree.

//Perfect Binary Tree.
