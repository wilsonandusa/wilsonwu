/*A binary search tree (BST) is a node based binary tree data structure which has the following properties.
• The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
• The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
• Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

From the above properties it naturally follows that:
• Each node (item in the tree) has a distinct key.*/
